This is a recent project that originated as a class project for Berkeley's CS280: Computer Vision course. The idea is to use neural networks, more precisely 3D convolutional neural network paired with GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic 3D mesh-based object.

Here's a paper on this research:

Hallucinating 3D objects has been done in the recent past, with vary degrees of success using binary voxels. VHowever I am more interested in developing a mesh-based framework that creates mesh-based objects
